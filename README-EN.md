## Using Commitizen

**Commitizen** makes it easier to standardize commits following conventions. To use it in the repository:  

1. Ensure you are in the project’s root directory.  
2. Run the following command to start Commitizen’s interactive wizard:  

```bash
   cz commit
```

> **Note**: If Commitizen is not yet configured in your environment, use the [PS-Commitzen-Setup](https://github.com/strFelix/PS-Commitzen-Setup) repository to complete the initial setup.  

### Commit Flow Using `cz commit`:  
1. Choose the type of commit (e.g., feat, fix, etc.).  
2. Enter the scope of the change (optional).  
3. Provide a short and clear description of the commit (optional).  
4. Specify if the change is a `BREAKING CHANGE` (press Enter to skip).  
5. Confirm the commit.  

> **Tip**: Read each step of the wizard carefully to ensure your commits are consistent and informative.

## Tasks

1. Use **Commitizen** (`cz commit`) to commit the following tasks individually:  
   1.1. Use the **correct tags** for each type of change.  
   1.2. Add **scopes** and descriptions (optional).  

### Task List:
- [X] Indent the code properly and remove debug lines and unnecessary comments.
- [X] Add a submit button to the registration screen and link the form to the handleSubmit() function. 
- [X] Check and fix the authorization for authenticated users after form submission.
- [X] Create a component for the form input to enable reuse in other parts of the project.

2. Update the project documentation by marking completed tasks with [X], following the described standards.

## Pull Request (PR)

1. After completing the tasks and creating commits, push the changes to GitHub.  
2. Open a **Pull Request (PR)** to the correct branch in the original repository.  
   - Make sure to clearly describe the changes in the PR.
